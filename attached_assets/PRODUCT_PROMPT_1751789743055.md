# ML Training Platform - Product Development Prompt

**Build a full-stack machine learning training platform with the following requirements:**

## Core Functionality - Real but Constrained Models

- **Pre-trained model fine-tuning only** (no training from scratch)
- **Small, practical models**: GPT-2 Small (124M params), DistilBERT, TinyBERT
- **Focused use cases**: Customer service bots, creative writing assistants, code completion helpers
- Dataset upload and preprocessing (text files, CSV, JSON) with automatic tokenization
- Real neural network fine-tuning with Hugging Face Transformers
- **Smart resource management**: Automatic batch sizing based on available memory
- Real-time training monitoring with loss tracking and logging
- Model inference/testing with actual text generation
- Model versioning and persistence

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI components  
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI for ML operations
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL-compatible for production
- **ML Libraries**: transformers, torch, datasets (Hugging Face ecosystem)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for training progress

## Radical Simplification

- **One-click model templates**: "Customer Service Bot", "Creative Writer", "Code Assistant"
- **Intelligent defaults**: Auto-configure learning rates, batch sizes, epochs based on data size
- **Natural language configuration**: "Make responses more creative" → temperature adjustment
- **Progressive disclosure**: Hide advanced options behind collapsible "Advanced Settings"
- **Smart preprocessing**: Automatic data validation and optimization suggestions
- **Template-driven workflow**: Pre-configured settings for common use cases

## Educational Integration

- **Live explanations**: Real-time tooltips explaining what's happening during training
- **Interactive tutorials**: Built-in guided workflows for each model type
- **Performance insights**: "Your model works well for questions under 50 words"
- **Visual learning**: Show attention patterns, loss curves with plain-English explanations
- **Success metrics**: Automated evaluation with human-readable quality assessments
- **Learning resources**: Contextual help explaining ML concepts as users encounter them

## Production-Ready Pipeline

- **Automatic optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning that requires no user intervention
- **Quality gates**: Automated model evaluation with clear pass/fail criteria
- **Background processing**: Training continues even if user closes browser
- **Robust error handling**: Clear error messages with suggested fixes
- **Model deployment**: One-click API endpoint creation with usage analytics
- **Performance monitoring**: Track model accuracy and response times in production
- **Automatic scaling**: Efficient resource usage on Replit's infrastructure

## Linux Compatibility Requirements

- Use cross-platform file paths (pathlib)
- Environment variable configuration (.env support)
- SQLite default with easy PostgreSQL migration
- Optimized for Replit deployment (single-port on 5000)
- CPU-optimized training with optional GPU acceleration detection
- Efficient memory management for constrained environments

## UI/UX Design (based on current excellent design)

- **Four-tab simplified workflow**: Template Selection → Data Upload → Training → Testing
- **Template-first approach**: Choose your use case before anything else
- **Drag-and-drop file uploads** with intelligent format detection
- **Real-time training dashboard** with beginner-friendly progress indicators
- **One-click testing interface** with sample prompts for each model type
- **Clean, mobile-responsive design** with step-by-step guidance
- **Smart onboarding**: Interactive tutorial for first-time users

## Key Simplified Features

- **Template library**: "Blog Writing Assistant", "Customer Support Bot", "Code Helper"
- **Smart data handling**: Automatic text cleaning and tokenization
- **Preset configurations**: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced complexity levels  
- **Automated evaluation**: Built-in quality scoring with improvement suggestions
- **Export options**: Download models in standard formats (ONNX, PyTorch)
- **Usage analytics**: Track how your deployed models perform

## Development Requirements

- **Type safety throughout** (TypeScript frontend, Pydantic backend)
- **Comprehensive error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Development hot-reload** for both frontend and backend
- **SQLite for local development** with seamless PostgreSQL upgrade path
- **Extensive logging and debugging** support for troubleshooting

## Deployment

- **Single-port deployment** on Replit (port 5000)
- **Environment-based configuration** for easy deployment
- **Automatic dependency management** with requirements.txt
- **Linux-first compatibility** with cross-platform support
- **Resource-optimized** for Replit's infrastructure

## Educational Focus

- **Built-in ML explanations**: Contextual learning without overwhelming users
- **Success examples**: Real case studies of models built with the platform
- **Quality guidance**: "Your model needs more diverse training data" with specific suggestions
- **Interactive learning**: Experiment with model parameters and see immediate effects

---

**Build this as a production-ready application that actually fine-tunes real language models, with radical simplification that makes ML accessible to complete beginners, comprehensive educational integration, and a focus on practical, constrained use cases that deliver real value.**

## Success Criteria

The platform should enable someone with zero ML experience to:
1. Upload their text data in under 2 minutes
2. Select an appropriate model template in 30 seconds
3. Start training with one click
4. Understand what's happening through clear explanations
5. Test their model and get useful results
6. Deploy their model for real use

This focuses on making ML training genuinely accessible while maintaining real functionality for the "vibe coding" generation.
