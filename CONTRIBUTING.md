- **Translations**: Internationalization support

## Architecture Overview

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/           # React frontend with TypeScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/           # Express.js backend with TypeScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/*.py       # Python ML services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/           # Shared types and schemas
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/            # Documentation
```

### Key Components

1. **Frontend**: React with Shadcn/UI components and TanStack Query
2. **Backend**: Express.js with WebSocket support for real-time updates
3. **ML Service**: Python with Hugging Face Transformers
4. **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL support
5. **Resource Management**: Smart detection and optimization

## Testing

### Frontend Tests
```bash
npm run test
npm run test:watch
```

### Backend Tests
```bash
npm run test:server
```

### Python Tests
```bash
python -m pytest server/tests/ -v
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Running in Different Environments

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Docker (Optional)
```bash
docker build -t ml-platform .
docker run -p 5000:5000 ml-platform
```

## Common Issues

### Python Dependencies
If you encounter Python import errors:
```bash
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

### Memory Issues
For training on low-memory systems:
- Use smaller batch sizes
- Enable gradient checkpointing
- Try FP16 precision

### WebSocket Connection Issues
Check that your firewall allows WebSocket connections on the development port.

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues
Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:
- Email: security@ml-platform.dev
- Include detailed reproduction steps
- We'll respond within 48 hours

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep dependencies updated

## Code Review Process

### What We Look For
- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Code Quality**: Is it readable and maintainable?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance implications?
- **Security**: Does it introduce security risks?
- **Tests**: Are there adequate tests?

### Review Timeline
- **Small PRs**: 1-2 days
- **Medium PRs**: 3-5 days
- **Large PRs**: 1 week

## Community

### Communication Channels
